    <h2>Scoring</h2>
    <p>Some of Ben Simmons best scoring qualities are his relentless finishing and deadeye at midrange.  Only the best defenders are able to slow down Ben Simmons abilities to score because his very long body combined with great speed allows him to be both very strong and very fast.</p>
    <p>He also has very good shooting touch with both hands in the paint, but needs to work on his 3 point shooting. His height and shooting ability allow him to pull up over defenders from almost anywhere within the 3 point arc.  He also has a good floater game which allows him to get easy baskets in the lane.</p>
