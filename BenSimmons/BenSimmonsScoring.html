<h1>Scoring</h1>
<p>Some of Ben Simmons best scoring qualities are his relentless finishing and deadeye at midrange.  Only the best defenders are able to slow down Ben Simmons abilities to score because his very long body combined with great speed allows him to be both very strong and very fast.  He also has very good shooting touch from the paint all the way to the three point line.  His height and shooting ability allow him to pull up over defenders from almost anywhere on the offensive end of the court.  He also has a good floater game which allows him to get easy baskets in the lane.</p>
