<h1 style="border:2px solid Violet;">Versatility</h1>
<p>Ben Simmons is very versatile due to his size.  He is 6’10” and 238 pounds.  His size and strength allows him to play every position and be a very good all around player.  He can play point guard or shooting guard due to his playmaking and speed.  He can play small forward, power forward, and center due to his size and strength.  It allows him to shoot over and finish through smaller defenders.  Don’t underestimate his speed either because he can blow by taller and bigger defenders.  His ball handling is also very good for his size which allows him to stay control and turn the ball over very rarely.</p>
